When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I would like to share the work with other collaborators or allow other people to suggest changes to the code.




Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I donâ€™t want to update my local repository if undesired changes were introduced (e.g. by others) on the remote in GitHub




Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: copy of repository inside GitHub. Used to copy a repository from someone else into our account in order to customise it.
    Clone: copy of repository from GitHub (or a folder in our personal computer) to a folder in our computer. Used to change the project inside our own computer.
    Branches: A group of commits. Initialised when one wants to test a different idea in the code of a project.




What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows me to compare the changes made by me and the last version pushed form GitHub when I was online.
