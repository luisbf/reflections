How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

it shows the lines that were removed from the old versions and 
added to the new version

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

it helps to know what lines of code improved specific features of the project

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

it allows the programmer to save logic steps.
However, the programmer might forget to save important changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

usually Git is used for coding files. They are related to each other.
Google Drive is not specific for coding files or correlated files. 
It is used for saving a bunch of files, not necessarily correlated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log allows me to view the different commits and the number of
insertions and deletions
git diff allows me to compare between different commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It allows me to always go back to a previous commit to see what caused 
the break to occur.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
